User levels
===========

- Administrator - full feature access and power to publish (Superuser or has "can_publish" permission)

- Editor - can edit content but can not publish (not Superuser and do not have "can_publish" permission)



The page model bear a specific permission for publishing ("can_publish"). This way any non-superuser bearing that permission will have the power to publish content.

The text editor used by default is redactor. You can use the one by Cotidia, but you will need to get your own license. http://imperavi.com/redactor/
