Publishing
==========

We differentiate between published pages and draft pages by setting the published option:

- True: The page will be hidden from the result list in the backend and will be use to render the live content
- False: The page is displayed and editable from the CMS

There are 2 more boolean which are there purely to command publishing and approval:

- Publish: it will trigger the generation of a clone published page
- Approval: it will trigger an email (to do!) to whoever has published permission to notify them about the new page.
